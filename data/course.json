  "course_description": "This seminar provides intensive study of texts by two American authors (Herman Melville, 1819-1891, and Toni Morrison, 1931-) who, using lyrical, radically innovative prose, explore in different ways epic notions of American identity. Focusing on Melville's _Typee_ (1846), _Moby-Dick_ (1851), and _The Confidence-Man_ (1857) and Morrison's _Sula_ (1973), _Beloved_ (1987), _Jazz_ (1992), and _Paradise_ (1998), the class will address their common concerns with issues of gender, race, language, and nationhood. Be prepared to read deeply (i.e. a small number of texts with considerable care), to draw on a variety of sources in different media, and to employ them in creative research, writing, and multimedia projects.\n",
